                I have had the opportunity to interview an IT professional in the area of cybersecurity at the 
                MB Bank. His current job is to check the updated information every day and ensure the safety of 
                the user. Most of people he comes into contact with is in the IT field as well as his colleagues. 
                He spends most of his time working at his company. Before that, he tried to create a simple game 
                to satisfy his childhood passion but did not go far. He said that his most difficult challenge is 
                when dealing with malicious code that stole customer information because each malicious code 
                is different, it has to be solved with different approaches such as finding the vulnerability or its 
                location to fix it. He also advised me that when I worked in the IT industry, I should have some 
                knowledge of IT fields, but I should be really good at one thing. It could be website, AI or game 
                programing.

                According to this project, I am a game programmer. Therefore, there are a lot of challenges in 
                the future. One of them is the rapid growth and competition in this field. That is also what the 
                expert told me. Every day, I have to see user feedback as well as errors in the game in order to 
                upgrade it and always update new game features.
