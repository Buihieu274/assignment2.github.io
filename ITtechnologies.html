            a. Computing cloud:

            Cloud computing is a computing model using the computer technologies and based on 
            Internet development. It will connect many servers together and use idle resources on each server 
            to serve web services, such as hosting, sharing or transferring data. Cloud computing will also 
            help society to cope with the increasing amount of data and support technologies like AI and 
            help them adapt to new platforms, such as mobile phone.

            b. Cybersecurity and privacy:

            Cybersecurity and privacy is the protection of the computer network from theft or damaging 
            hardware, software and data. It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the 
            unauthorized exploitation of systems, networks and technologies.

            I think that anyone or any business needs it because when producing technology products or 
            data, people must always protect them from the attack of cybercriminals. When companies pivot 
            more toward digital business models, more data is generated and shared among organizations, 
            partners and customers. The digital information has become threatened by people who want to 
            steal the information. Therefore, it makes cybersecurity and privacy more important than ever.

            I know that the technology products around me are using cybersecurity and privacy, such as 
            Internet banking, Facebook, Instagram or Google accounts. In the future, this technology will 
            continue to grow.
